## Why?
Sometimes what you need is just a small lightweight Twitch chat running inside your game for your cheap PC while you do a stream for your frieds.

## Q&A
### Everyone in my party will see my chat?
> No! Only you will see Twitch chat!

### I'll get a ban using this?
> No! This script uses [Valorant](https://github.com/techchrism/valorant-api-docs) and [Twitch.tv](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc#getting-started-with-chat--chatbots) APIs, so theoricaly will not get you a ban.

### I need administrator privileges to use this?
> No! Such privilege isn't necessary!

### I need to disable my antivirus?
> Probably. Since this is new, it may be necessary that you mark as false positive in your antivirus program. This is open source and remember that you're free to read the code.
